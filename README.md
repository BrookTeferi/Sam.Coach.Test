## Introduction

Sam.Coach is a C# library designed to find the longest rising sequence in a collection of numbers. This library implements the `ILongestRisingSequenceFinder` interface, providing a method to asynchronously find the longest rising sequence in a given collection of integers.

## Usage

To use the `LongestRisingSequenceFinder` in a project, first, add the Sam.Coach package to the project. Then, we can use the `Find` method as follows:

  foreach (var number in result)
      {
          Console.WriteLine(number);
      }
  }

This example demonstrates how to find the longest rising sequence in a list of integers.
